## Current Status
Designing Circuits

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a guitar amp that can take a 1/4" input from an instrument or sound-making device, add some color to the sound through a reverb and distortion module, and output that sound through a speaker. The effects module will be able to be toggled on and off.

## Educational Value Added
For one, as my one first larger scale projects in an area I know next to nothing about, I will be learning how to approach learning and applying new knowledge quickly, as well as how to manage my time so I do not become overwhelmed by the knowledge base I need to build. I will learn how to design circuits, more specifically circuits working with op-amps and power-amps. I will also learn how to solder and properly assemble to various components involved in creating an amplifier.

## Tasks
- Learn about the components used to create an amplifier such as op-amps and power-amps.
- Design the circuitry
- Build prototypes of the circuitry
- Test the prototypes
- Iterate over design flaws
- Finalize design
- Build final product

## Design Decisions
The largest three components of the amplifier are an op-amp which goes into an effects module which goes into a power-amp. The op-amp boosts the signal to a line-level signal, the effects module contains effects like reverb and distortion, and the power-amp takes the signal and boosts it to a level it can be heard out of a speaker.

## Steps for Documenting Your Design Process
I will be debriefing the progress after each meeting and writing up my main takeways.

## Timeline
Have a working amplifier by the end of the fall 2023 Semester:
- Complete designs by mid October
- Start building and testing in November
- Finalize designs by December
