OVERVIEW:
The design of our amplifier consists of a preamp, effects processing unit, and power amp.
The preamp converts the signal into a usable level, the effects amp alters the quality and effects on the sound, and the power amp boosts the level up to a volume that could be heard out of a speaker.

PREAMP DESIGN:
The intention of the preamp is to prep the signal for the effects processing unit.
The preamp consists of a noninverting op amp that goes straight into an inverting op amp. We chose this order because noninverting op amps have a high input impedance due to the signal input going straight into
the op amp's noninverting input. A high input impedance is important because high current impedances minimize the effects that driving the speaker (the load) cause on the input signal [2]. High input impedances allow
the signal transferred to the circuit to be more accurate to the signal input [1][2]. The output impedance on guitars genrally is high; connecting output impedance of a guitar to an amp with a much higher input impedance
will allow most of the signal to be transferred [3]. We do not want to match the impedances because matching impedances considers maximizing power transfer. In order to maximize power transfer, we need a high input impedance.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
A low imput impedance allows the load to affect the signal. For example, multimeters (the load in this example) have a high impedance so connecting the probs to the circuit does not change the circuit by adding a new route for electrons
to travel through (the potential change would be the loading effects in this example). A high impedance allows the signal to remain with the same qualities through through amp, but with an amplified signal level. [2]

which takes away from our signal.

the matching the input impedance of the guitar to that of the circuit
can lower the interferrance and noise in the circuit and output through the speaker. An impedance mismatch can cause noise in the circuit.
