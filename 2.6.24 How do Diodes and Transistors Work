If you can understand how a diode works, you can understand how a transistor works.
-Peter

A diode is constructed of a two electrodes, an anode and a cathode. The anode is made from a P-type material and the cathode is made from an N-type material.
The P-type region is comprised of holes (the absense of electrons makes positive), and the N-type region consists of electrons.
The P-type region will be an element with 3 electrons and the N-type region will be an element with 5 electrons.
Both P-type and N-type regions are semiconductors (material that conducts in certain states), in this case Silicon.
The P-type region is made up with mostly Silicon, but is doped with a small number of other atoms with one fewer electron that fits nicely with Silicon: this yields a positive charge.
The N-type region is made up with mostly Silicon, but is dope with a small number of other atoms with one extra electron that fits nicely with Silicon: this yields a negative charge.
The region in the middle of the two semiconductors is called the depletion region.

In order to make all this stuff make sense, let's jump back in time to World War I. I want to talk about trench warefare.
Picture two trenches, and between these two trenches is no mans land. No soldier from either the good or bad side wants to cross this region.
If reinforcements are sent to the good side (positive voltage applied), the good troops have cover fire and can push closer to no man's land.
The same concept pertains to the bad side (negative).
If positive voltage is towards the holes in the P-type side and negative voltage is towards the electrons in the N-type side, the holes and electrons
are pushed closer and closer to the depletion region; the more voltage applied, the smaller the depletion region, and the faster holes and electrons will jump across the depletion region.
In the case of LEDs, this process creates photons (light); Photons are created when elements in groups 3 and 5 mix.

Current will not flow through the diode if the voltage applied is backwards. When negative voltage is towards the P-type side, it is like sending soldiers from the opposition in a flank attack,
the P-type soldiers have to turn around and fight the flanking enemies-no man's land becomes larger.
Negative voltage applied to the positive side attracts the holes towards the negative electrons and away from the depletion region.
Positive voltage applied to the positive side repulses the holes towards the depletion region, shrinking the depletion region and allowing current to flow through the diode.

Uses:
You can use diodes to set a maximum voltage. There is a overflow hole in most sinks. The sink fills with water normally until the water fills up to the overflow hole. No matter the amount of water that comes
out of the sink, the water in the sink stops getting higher because the extra pours into the overflow hole. Diodes can be used for a similar purpose with alternating current. The signal will be normal until there
is a great enough voltage difference across the diode that it turns on. Once the diode turns on the voltage is clipped; the signal will appear normal when the diode is off and appear clipped when the diode is on.


Transistors.
The two main types of transistors are NPN and PNP. The side notated with an arrow is called the emitter. The other end is called a collector. The middle is called the base.
We can compare a transistor to a water valve. The base is the valve; as voltage is applied to the base, the valve is opened and more and more water (current) is let through at greater speeds. The current
travels from the collector to the emitter. For the transistor to be considered on, the transistor needs to have a voltage applied across the collector and a emitter. If you turn off a sink, the water goes all the
way back down the pipes, if you keep the sink barely on, the water sits right at the faucet ready to pour out.

Uses:
We are using a Class B setup of transistors to gain up current in order to drive our speaker. The Class B setup uses two transistors-one to gain the positive signal and one to gain the negative signal. As we described with diodes,
the voltage needs to be applied in the correct way so that no man's land shrink and current can flow across the diode. As voltage is positive, the positive transistor is turned on. As voltage is negative, the negative transistor is turned on.
