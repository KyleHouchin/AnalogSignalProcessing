If you can understand how a diode works, you can understand how a transistor works.
-Peter

A diode is constructed of a two electrodes, an anode and a cathode. The anode is made from a P-type material and the cathode is made from an N-type material.
The P-type region is comprised of holes (the absense of electrons makes positive), and the N-type region consists of electrons.
The P-type region will be an element with 3 electrons and the N-type region will be an element with 5 electrons.
A semiconductor (material that conducts in certain states), in this case Silicon, is between these two regions. The region in the middle is called the depletion region.

In order to make all this stuff make sense, let's jump back in time to World War I. I want to talk about trench warefare.
Picture two trenches, and between these two trenches is no mans land. No soldier from either the good or bad side wants to cross this region.
If reinforcements are sent to the good side (positive voltage applied), the good troops have cover fire and can push closer to no man's land.
The same concept pertains to the bad side (negative).
If positive voltage is towards the holes in the P-type side and negative voltage is towards the electrons in the N-type side, the holes and electrons
are pushed closer and closer to the depletion region; the more voltage applied, the smaller the depletion region, and the faster holes and electrons will jump across the depletion region.
In the case of LEDs, this process creates photons (light); Photons are created when elements in groups 3 and 5 mix.

Current will not flow through the diode if the voltage applied is backwards. When negative voltage is towards the P-type side, it is like sending soldiers from the opposition in a flank attack,
the P-type soldiers have to turn around and fight the flanking enemies-no man's land becomes larger.
Negative voltage applied to the positive side attracts the holes towards the negative electrons and away from the depletion region.
Positive voltage applied to the positive side repulses the holes towards the depletion region, shrinking the depletion region and allowing current to flow through the diode.
