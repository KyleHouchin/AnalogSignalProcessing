A speaker needs to be driven.
Imagine a strong man trying to break a door open: Barely tapping the door is not going to break it open. He needs to run at the door with a high speed and kinetic energy so that the door breaks down.
In a similar way, in order to make a speaker pump sound, it needs to be driven by enough current.

I had a friend ask me recently if a speaker individually played the different sounds in a song or played all the sounds at once. The actual answer is that the speaker plays a mix of the sounds.
Waves add together through a concept called "superposition."
Let two waves be of the same amplitude: Waves can add constructively, i.e. crest + crest = taller crest; waves also add destructively, i.e. crest + trough = no signal.
If these waves were not lined up in a perfectly constructive or destructive wave, a mix of points of the wave would be amplified and lessend.
